        let aboutMe = "##  Bringing Ideas to Life Through Code\n\nI'm Chris, a New York City-based full-stack software developer with a passion for transforming innovative ideas into tangible digital experiences. My journey in the tech world began long before my immersive dive into software engineering at Purdue University.  I honed my skills and collaborated on impactful projects at renowned companies like Bloomberg LP and BBDO Worldwide, gaining valuable experience in understanding user needs and building solutions that make a difference. I also work on side projects whenever I am less busy with stuff. Some of my side projects are 1. ReBlug - a social platform for bloggers; 2. PublicTrades - An umbrella company under which all my projects are created. \n\nWhile my days are spent immersed in the world of Javascript, React, and Node.js, my evenings and weekends are dedicated to the most rewarding role I have: being a dad to my four amazing kids. When I'm not busy building the next big thing in the digital world, you can find me indulging my love for fishing, enjoying the vibrant tapestry of New York City through people-watching, or simply embracing the ebb and flow of life â€“ sometimes as a social butterfly, other times seeking solace in introspection.\n\nWhether it's crafting a sleek user interface or tackling complex backend challenges, I approach each project with a dedication to clean code, efficient solutions, and a touch of creative flair. I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers and explore new opportunities where I can contribute my skills and passion to impactful projects. Let's build something extraordinary together! \n"
